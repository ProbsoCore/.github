# Why compassion-centered?

People have a basic attitude of wanting to help others. Some people are willing to help because they want to share their experiences or pieces of knowledge. Because of their willingness to help, they easily give suggestions about others' problems based on their supposed opinions. Their supposed opinions are formed out of their life situation and experience. Their suggestion can be upsetting to some people who need help because they are both different in life situations and experiences they have been through. In that kind of case, compassion is very important. That's why I m thinking to develop a compassion-centred social platform, especially for people who need it.

> Reminder : What I want to remind the reader here is I am talking about compassion. Not empathy. Compassion and empathy can be misinterpreted.

# What are considered as problems?

Anything which you considered as a problem for you was a kind of problem. It can be a tiny problem or little problem or medium problem or big problem or a huge problem. It can differ by age group. It can also vary depending on your circumstances and life experience.
